# AGENT IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS — Clear & Actionable

## What Happened
1. **Your Blueprint** → Complete 7-week plan for ALL 5 modules (16 bugs)
2. **Agent Plan** → 4-sprint plan for INTERVIEW module only (10 bugs)
3. **Result** → Agent's plan is good but INCOMPLETE

---

## AGENT: THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### ❌ What Agent Got WRONG (Fix These First)

**Wrong #1: Do NOT Delete InterviewSession.tsx**
- Your plan: "Delete InterviewSession.tsx completely" ❌
- Correct: "Rewrite InterviewSession.tsx as a state machine" ✅
- Impact: Deleting breaks the entire routing; rewriting keeps the file and route intact

**Wrong #2: Narrowed Scope to Interview Only**
- Your plan covers: Interview module only
- Should cover: All 5 modules (Auth, Aptitude, Learning, Interview, Dashboard)
- Impact: 6 critical bugs remain unfixed

**Wrong #3: Missed Creating 4 Custom Hooks**
- Your plan: Assumes hooks exist
- Should do: Create hooks from scratch in Section 8.3 of blueprint
- Impact: Voice interview won't work without these

---

## CORRECTED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: 7 WEEKS

## How to Instruct Agent with This Document

**When giving agent these instructions, say:**

```
"You have created a good 4-sprint plan for the Interview module.
However, the complete project has 5 modules and 16 bugs.

Your plan covers only the Interview module (Sprints 0-3).
You must EXPAND to cover ALL 5 modules across 7 weeks.

I'm providing you a CORRECTED PLAN that integrates your work 
with the missing modules.

Follow this plan EXACTLY:
- Keep your Sprint 0, 1, 2, 3 work AS-IS
- Expand to Weeks 1-7 as specified
- Do NOT delete InterviewSession.tsx, rewrite it instead
- Create all 4 hooks from scratch in Week 3
- Add full Aptitude backend in Week 2
- Add Dashboard real APIs in Week 7

All code is provided in the blueprint (Section references given).
Test after each week before moving to next week."
```
