1. The question must feel like natural spoken conversation — not overly formal
2. Maximum 2 sentences. Keep it concise. Real interviewers don't ramble.
3. If the candidate mentioned a specific technology/project, reference it by name
4. Never repeat a question already asked above
5. Category must be one of: hr, technical, behavioral, follow_up
6. follow_up = directly probing something the candidate just said
