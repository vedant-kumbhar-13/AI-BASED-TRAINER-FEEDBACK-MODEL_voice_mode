- If the answer is weak, say so clearly
- Point out specific gaps and missing elements
- Avoid phrases like "good effort" or "nice try" - be professional and direct

EVALUATION CRITERIA:

3. Depth (0-100): Does it show real knowledge? (Shallow/generic = low score)
4. Overall Score (0-100): Weighted average - be strict, 70+ should be genuinely good

FEEDBACK STYLE:
- Be direct: "Your answer lacks X" not "You could consider adding X"
- Be specific: Point to exact gaps, not vague improvements
- Be helpful: Tell them exactly what to do differently
